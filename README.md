#Simon Says 
Memory Game Web App
Description:

"Simon Says" is an interactive and visually engaging memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to mimic a sequence of colors shown by the computer, testing and enhancing the player’s memory skills. With each successful level, the game increases in complexity by adding a new color to the pattern, challenging the player to recall longer sequences.

Key Features:

🟢 Dynamic Color Sequences: Random color patterns are generated on each level.

🧠 User Interaction: Players replicate the sequence by clicking the colored buttons.

🔁 Progressive Difficulty: Each level adds a new color to the existing pattern.

🎯 Score Tracking: Real-time scoring based on levels achieved (each level = 100 points).

🏆 High Score Tracking: Tracks and displays the max score even after a game over.

🚨 Game Over Feedback: Provides clear game-over message and visual feedback (flashing red).

🎨 Minimal UI Design: Clean layout with colorful buttons and responsive design.

Tech Stack:

HTML5 – Structure of the game page.

CSS3 – Styling of the buttons and game layout.

Vanilla JavaScript – Core game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

How It Works:

Press any key to start the game.

A color flashes—click the matching button.

If you match the sequence, the game adds another color.

Continue until you make a mistake—then the game ends and your score is displayed.
